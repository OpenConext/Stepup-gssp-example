Example Generic SAML Stepup Provider.

This repository can be used for reference material or 
as a base project setup for new IdP SecondFactor application.

The SAML logic for receiving authentication request (AuthnRequest) and sending authentication response back is
placed inside the Symfony bundle [stepup-gssp-bundle](https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-gssp-bundle). The state of the
application is stored inside PHP sessions, each new request will invalidate the current session state.

Locale user preference
----------------------

The default locale is based on the user agent. When the user switches its locale the selected preference is stored inside a
browser cookie (stepup_locale). The cookie is set on naked domain of the requested domain (for gssp.stepup.example.com this is example.com).

Authentication and registration flows
-------------------------------------

The application provides internal (SpBundle) and a remote service provider. Instructions for this are given 
on the homepage of this example project [Homepage](https://gssp.stepup.example.com/app_dev.php/).

How to create your own Stepup Provider
======================================

There are two ways to approach this. 

Copy this GSSP example repository
---------------------------------

One of the benefits of using this repository is that it contains many pre-configured tools:

* Metrics & test tooling [testing.md](./docs/testing.md)
* Development environment provisioned by Vagrant 
* Pre-configured travis.yml for CI integration
* Default SurfContext styling [frontend_tooling.md](./docs/frontend_tooling.md)

1) Clone and checkout this repository
2) Change the project configuration variables:
    * composer.json name and description
    * this readme.md file
    * Replace 'gssp.stepup.example.com' in all files with your own hostename
3) Install the copied project. (See [Development environment](#) section of this README.md file)
4) Implement your authentication & registration logic in DefaultController::registrationAction and DefaultController::authenticateAction. 
5) Feel free to rename and change this example clone for your needs.

Install from a clean or exiting symfony project
------------------------------------

1) [Install Symfony](http://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html) 
2) Follow the instructions from the [GSSP bundle](https://github.com/OpenConext/Stepup-gssp-bundle)

Development environment
======================

The purpose of the development environment is only for running the different test and metric tools.

To get started, first setup the development environment. The dev. env. is a virtual machine. Every task described is run
from that machine.  

Requirements
-------------------
- vagrant 2.2.x
    - vagrant-hostsupdater (1.1.1.160, global)
    - vagrant-vbguest (0.19.0, global)
- Virtualbox

Install
-------------------
``` cd homestead && composer install ```

``` vagrant up ```

If everything goes as planned you can develop inside the virtual machine

``` vagrant ssh ```

Build frontend assets:

``` composer encore dev ``` or ``` composer encore prod ``` for production 

If everything goes as planned you can go to:

[https://gssp.stepup.example.com](https://gssp.stepup.example.com/app_dev.php)

Debugging
-------------------
Xdebug is configured when provisioning your development Vagrant box. 
It's configured with auto connect IDE_KEY=phpstorm and ```xon``` on cli env. 

Tests and metrics
======================

To run all required test you can run the following commands from the dev env:

```bash 
    composer test 
```

Every part can be run separately. Check "scripts" section of the composer.json file for the different options.

Release instructions
